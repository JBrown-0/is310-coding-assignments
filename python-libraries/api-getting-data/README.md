# GETting Culture Across APIs

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fetch data from two different APIs: Google Drive API and the Europeana API. The script fetches data about a file from Google Drive and then finds related data in the Europeana collection.

## APIs Used
1. **Google Drive API**: Provides access to files stored in Google Drive.
   - URL: https://developers.google.com/drive/api
   - Purpose: To list files in Google Drive and use the file names to search for related data in Europeana.

2. **Europeana API**: Provides access to millions of digitized items from European museums, galleries, libraries, and archives.
   - URL: https://www.europeana.eu/en/rights/api
   - Purpose: To find related cultural data based on the file names retrieved from Google Drive.

## Setup Instructions

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/is310-coding-assignments.git
