# Source and Style Assignment

## Website: NBA.com

### Technologies Used

NBA.com is built using various web technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Below are examples of each:

- **HTML**: NBA.com uses HTML for structuring its content. Here's an example of an HTML `<iframe>` tag used to embed advertisements:

  ```html
  <iframe frameborder="0" src="https://1eddb2f….safeframe.googlesyndication.com/safeframe/1-0-40/html/container.html" 
          id="google_ads_iframe_/8663477/NBA/homepage_0" 
          title="3rd party ad content" 
          name scrolling="no" 
          marginwidth="0" 
          marginheight="0" 
          width="320" 
          height="50" 
          data-is-safeframe="true" 
          sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" 
          allow="private-state-token-redemption;attribution-reporting" 
          aria-label="Advertisement" 
          tabindex="0" 
          style="border: 0px; vertical-align: bottom;" 
          data-google-container-id="1" 
          data-load-complete="true">
  </iframe>
  CSS: NBA.com uses CSS to handle the visual presentation of the website. Here's an example of a CSS rule that hides overflow when the .storyteller-player-visible class is active:

  body:has(.storyteller-player-visible) { 
    overflow: hidden !important;
  }
  JavaScript: JavaScript is used for interactivity and performance monitoring on NBA.com. For instance, this script is used for tracking website performance via New Relic:


<script src="https://js-agent.newrelic.com/nr-spa-1177.min.js"></script>

Other Files: While browsing the website, I encountered .json files in the background that are likely used for data transfer between the front-end and back-end services.

Who Built This Website?
NBA.com was likely built and maintained by a team of professional developers, including front-end and back-end developers, as well as external service providers. The website's complexity and usage of advertising services (e.g., Google Ads) indicate that both internal NBA developers and third-party contractors contribute to its creation and maintenance.

GitHub Repository
There is no public GitHub repository available for NBA.com. This suggests that the website’s code is private and maintained either by the NBA’s internal development team or external contractors.
